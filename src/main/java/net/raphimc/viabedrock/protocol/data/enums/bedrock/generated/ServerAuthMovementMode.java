     * Additionally, in this mode many client-bound packets have a 'Tick' value. These echo back the tick value that the client supplies in the PlayerAuthInputPacket.<br>
     * For packets relating to a player or client predicted vehicle, the tick value should be that of the most recently processed PlayerAuthInputPacket from the player.<br>
     * Specifying zero is also acceptable although may result in minor visual flickering as it may confuse client predicted actions.
